## Introduction

The [Centre of Excellence for Advanced Technology Aerial Firefighting](https://www.cofiretech.org/) is pioneering the deployment of [TAK](https://tak.gov/) as a Public Safety Tool.

The vast majority of our work is funded by the taxpayer and is open-sourced to assist other states in their deployment and rollout of TAK for Public Safety
